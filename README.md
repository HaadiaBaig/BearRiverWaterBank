# Immersive Model for a Water Bank for Bear River Basin

## Purpose

The purpose of this immersive online collaborative model is to give collaborators the opportunity to immerse in and personify water user roles for a water bank for Bear River Basin. The tool is useful for two purposes; as researchers we want to know A) Why do people decide to consume, conserve, bank, and deliver water within the immersive modeling environments? B) Which new insights do participants take away from a model session? C) How can an immersive online collaborative modeling approach help generate holistic strategies to address the multidisciplinary, multi-user, and conflict-laden problem to get more water to Great Salt Lake?

## Key Ideas

The model works on the following principles A) Store winter flows in Bear Lake. B) Divide summer natural flows to users. C) Users consume, conserve or trade within their available water, other’s choices, and real-time discussion of choices.

### Potential Target Elevation (PTE)

PacifiCorp determines the PTE, which represents the elevation of Bear Lake to be achieved, on March 31st of each year. PTE may range from 5916 ft - 5920 ft (high runoff – low runoff). Under normal conditions, PacifiCorp sets PTE at 5918 ft. This strategy balances long-term water supply needs during droughts with flood control requirements.

The Bear Lake's level is managed based on its level at the end of the irrigation season. If the elevation is 5918 ft or higher, releases are scheduled to maintain this level by March 31st. If it's below 5918 ft, water releases are delayed until forecasts indicate the lake can reach that elevation or if high snowpack requires flood control releases. During winter, if forecasts suggest below-average runoff, releases may be curtailed even if the elevation exceeds 5918 ft. Generally, water will not be released from Bear Lake when its elevation is below the PTE, except during emergencies or for flood control.

### Additional Depletions

Different users have allowance of additional depletions per Bear River compact.

1.  Different divisions in the Bear River Basin are allowed additional storage or depletions under certain conditions. The upstream Bear Lake users are allowed an additional storage of 74,000 acft such that the depletions do not exceed 28,000 acft in any year IF the Bear Lake level on Apr 1st is more than 5911 ft. In the model, this depletion amount is used. If users don’t deplete this amount, it is sold to the bank.

For lower ID, the users are allowed an additional 125,000 acft of depletion if water is available. If users have water excess water available and they don’t deplete this amount, it is sold to the bank.

## Model

To use, download the Excel Model File, move to Google Sheets, and invite participants. There are accounts for different water users in the Bear River Basin. Over one or more years, participants consume and trade water in the accounts. Read on for directions to use.

### Model Assumptions

1.  The bank works on a yearly basis. There is no carry-over storage.
2.  The users make decisions to consume or trade water based on historic water use which is used in the model as a proxy to the water they are entitled to use.
3.  Each user manages all their available water in that year.
4.  All the depletions occur in the summer season.
5.  We use natural flow in the model. It is the flow that would have been observed if there were no depletions,
6.  The streamflow losses (evaporation, seepage, delivery losses) are assumed to be 30% for summer season and 10% for winter season.
7.  Cache Valley users draw water from the Little Bear River – Logan River system, they cannot trade with users from Bear Lake.
-   The net water available from Cache Valley for the “Bank” is assumed to kept in reservoirs or “Bank” in Cache Valley and made available in winter season (Ref: Cache Valley Water Bank).

### Requirements

1.  Session Guide: 1 person to setup in Google Sheets (see Setup below), invite participants, and organize play.
2.  Number of People: 2 or more (Session Guide may also participate).
3.  Time: 1 to 2 hours.
4.  Software: Session Guide has a Google Account.

## Directions to Guide a Model Session

### Setup

1.  Download the file BearRiverWaterBank.xlsx to your computer.
2.  Move the Excel file to your Google Drive. Open as a Google Sheet.
3.  Open the *Versions* Worksheet to see updates.
4.  Duplicate the *Model* Worksheet to work on in this session and save a blank version for later use.
5.  Invite 1 or more other people to join the Google Sheet. In the upper right of the Google Sheet, click the Share button.
6.  Add emails and set permissions so players can access the Google Sheet. Or copy and share the sheet's URL.
7.  Use.

### Model Session

1.  On the Model worksheet, scroll down Column B. The instructions are given in rows with Blue text. For example, in Rows 6-11, participants select a User and enter the User's Strategy to participate in the banking. If fewer than 5 participants, participants select multiple parties
2.  In Cell 30, select the Bear Lake starting level for start of the water year.
3.  In Cell C38, select one of the historical natural flow for the year, the users jointly decide the natural flow.
    -   The model shows the year for the selected flow.
4.  Winter natural flow.
5.  The natural flow from upstream is added to the bear lake storage
6.  Row 41-45, the model calculates the natural flow from October – March for each user.
7.  In Cell C48 select the March 1st Potential Target Elevation (PTE) for the Bear Lake. This is the elevation to be achieved for Bear Lake on March 31st. Historically, PTE is kept at 5916 ft for expected high runoff years to accommodate spring runoff, 5920 ft for low runoff years, and 5918 ft in average year ([Read about Potential Target Elevation](#potential-target-elevation-pte)).
    -   If there is excess water in the lake corresponding to the lake level, excess water is spilled.
8.  Row 55-59, the model calculates the natural flow from April – September for each user.
9.  Row 61-65, the model calculates the historic depletions by each user.

### Participant Dashboard

10. Model allocates available natural flow in each basin.
11. The net available water for each user is calculated with the formula

    *Net available water = Natural Flow – Streamflow losses – Non-Ag Depletions – Upstream consumptive use derived from flow (if any) – water bought or sold from the bank –* **water conserved in the bank.**

    -   For Cache Valley, UT the non ag depletions are considered to be 0 as mainly all of the urban water is sourced from underground sources.
12. Model shows the historic consumptive use for the year for the user.
13. Model shows if there is any additional depletion is allowed based on the Bear River Compact and / or other agreements.
14. The user decides the consumptive use of water that year based on historic use and additional depletions allowed.
    -   If there is enough water available in the river, the user gets water from the available water. For users downstream Bear Lake, the users can take additional water from the lake to meet their consumptive use without a charge.
    -   If the user decides to consume more than their historic use, they need to buy the water from bank.
    -   If the available water is less than the historic water use, then the users can either decide to take water from the lake or sell their entitlement from the lake to the bank.
15. Model calculates the water to sell or buy based on the user’s decision of consumptive use.
16. User sets or negotiates the price of water (\$/acft) with the bank.
17. Row 135 – 139, the model calculates the net water traded and the compensation (\$) for the bank.

### End of Summer Summary

18. The model summarizes the total water available before and after the consumptive use and trades.
19. Streamflow losses
20. The model summarizes the Bear Lake levels at the beginning of year and at the end of summer after all uses and trades have happened.
21. The bank decides how much water to deliver to the Great Salt Lake.
22. The model calculates end of year Bear Lake storage and Levels.
23. The end of year Bear Lake level becomes the beginning of year Bear Lake level for the next year.
